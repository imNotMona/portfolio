        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p> 
            I'm currently a student at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities aiming
            for a bachelors in science for computer science.                                                                                                    
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>I prefer simple solutions, readable code, and interfaces that
        work well without crazy complex spaghetti code</p>
        <br>
        <p> 
            I already have some industry experience under my belt, and I aim to add more.                                                                                                  
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Other Tid-Bits</h3>
        <p>
            I'm interested in cybersecurity. I am pursuing this point further during my college 
            career. I've taught myself how to use Krita for digital art. I also enjoy dark fantasy
            novels and games. Big fan of 'The Witcher' and 'Dark Souls'.
