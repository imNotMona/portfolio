        <h2>monaOS - linux based operating system</h2>
        <p> 
            I'm interested in linux, so I went
            through all the motions of "Linux From Scratch" to get a better understanding.
            I made this in the operating systems club at the university of minnesota. I recently uploaded it to my 
            git page. You can format it with rufus to make a bootable USB.
